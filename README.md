# Metabolic-Syndrome

Project Overview
This project is an in-depth analysis of Metabolic Syndrome, a complex medical condition linked to cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Utilizing Python, machine learning, and deep learning techniques, the study aims to extract insights from a dataset of individuals with Metabolic Syndrome. A significant part of the project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data characteristics before applying predictive modeling.

Key Features
Comprehensive EDA to uncover patterns, anomalies, correlations, and trends in the dataset.
Application of machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze Metabolic Syndrome data.
Best model performance achieved using CatTreeClassifier, demonstrating its efficacy in complex datasets.
Technologies Used
Python
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
Deep Learning Libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras)
Data Analysis and Visualization Libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Dataset Description
The dataset encompasses a wide array of features including demographic details, clinical markers, and laboratory measurements, such as age, gender, marital status, income level, race, waist circumference, BMI, and Albuminuria.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure all required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt are installed.
Execute the script metabolic_syndrome.py to perform EDA and subsequent analyses.
Review the outputs for detailed EDA insights and model performance metrics.
Results and Discussion
